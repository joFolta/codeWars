Find the unique number

There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

This is the first kata in series:

Find the unique number (this kata)
Find the unique string
Find The Unique
*/

function findUniq(arr) {
  arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  const first = arr[0];
  const second = arr[1];
  return first === second ? arr[arr.length - 1] : arr[0];
}
